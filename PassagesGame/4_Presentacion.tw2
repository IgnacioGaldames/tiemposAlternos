- So, $recluta. What was so important.
- General $reclutaLastName was my grandfather...
- Was... ?
- Yes. A Skinny betrayed us, leading the attack of Rhino Warriors. He was mauled yesterday. 
- I see. 
- He told me this was the best unit. So, I enlisted this morning. But my mother doesn't approve.
- He was a good officer. He trained me on the Marauder Unit.
- Well, $recluta. I have only one rule. Everyone fights. No one quits. You don't do your job, I'll shoot you.
- Sir, yes, sir.
- The battalion has already started the basic training. You are behind.
- I know, sir. I'll do my best, sir.
- The Federation needs Heroes like you. In honor of the general I will train you myself. If you survive the basic training, you will earn your citizenship.
